Fabric/Quilt Loader port of the Minecraft mod [Chalk](https://github.com/mortuusars/Chalk) by mortuusars with some additions and 1.17+ adjustments.  

**Adds two simple types of chalk to aid you on your mining journeys. Never lose your way again.**

Thank you very much for creating the original Forge version and the permission to port Chalk to fabric!  

## Requires  
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) *or* [Quilted Fabric API (QFAPI)](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)  

## Adds:  
- Chalk: Crafted shapeless with two Calcite  
- Glow Chalk: Crafted shapeless with two Calcite and a Glow Ink Sac  

With chalk, you are able to mark the surface of every full block.  
Hitting the corner of a block creates an arrow pointing in that direction, hitting the center creates an X.  
Marks from Glow Chalk can be seen in total darkness, perfect for caving action!  

## Addons  
[Chalk: Colorful Addon](https://modrinth.com/mod/chalk-colorful-addon) adds variants of chalk in every color!
